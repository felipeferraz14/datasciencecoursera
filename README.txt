The run_analysis.R is a simple script created in order to clean a data set.

The step belows proceeds the script
1 - Download the datasets
2 - Merge de two different datasets (Training and Test data)
3 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6 - Writes a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
